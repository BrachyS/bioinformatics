Thie repo included the algorithms I wrote for analyzing DNA sequence data.
Topics include naive-exact matching, Boyer-Moore matching, approximate matching, edit-distance, finding largest overlaps, shortest common superstring, and genome assembly using greedy shortest common superstring algorithm.

I borrowed some functions and data from the Johns Hopkins Coursera course on DNA algorithms. Many thanks and credits to the wonderful teachers, Ben Langmead and Jacob Pritt.
